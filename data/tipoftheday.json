    "MG-RAST has a reviewer feature, allowing you to create anonymous access for journal reviewers.",
    "Data publication requires the user interaction, MG-RAST will never automatically release data. Data is not public until you release it!",
    "Changing parameters for comparisons and data exports is a core function of MG-RAST enabling you to narrow comparisons down.",
    "You can select a taxonomic group (e.g. Actinobacteria) or function (e.g. Lysine Biosynthesis) and extract all sequence features matched to said group or function for downstream analysis.",
    "MG-RAST has an R interface. <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/matR/index.html' target=_blank>",
    "The MG-RAST API allows platform agnostic access to the data and analysis in MG-RAST. <a href='http:://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/api.html' target=_blank>",
    "You can retrieve a list of species or set of features linked to a specific functional category, e.g. KEGG pathway or SEED subsystem.",
    "You can retrieve a set of functions or functional categories (and/or the respective features) for a specific taxonomic group.",
    "Collections offer a convenient way to group metagenomes and facilitate easier analysis.",
    "If you upload assembled or or other manipulated sequence data sets, please also upload the raw sequences. This will assist other researchers."
